    <h2 align=center>What is LINUX?</h2>
    <p>Linux is a UNIX-like operating system, In fact in the README file of the Linux kernel under the “What is Linux” section it states “Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance. It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.” (1)</p>
