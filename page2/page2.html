    <h2 align=center>Why the interest in Software Engineering?</h2>
    <p>I always thought the concept of creating things from nothing but code was always interesting to me, I've played tons of games where people used their own code to create content in the form of mods to games and the only problem I had with that is that eventually that modder would eventulaly quit the game or stop coding for whatever reason, and they'd leave their mod's source code for anyone to pick up and use. But being me and being inexperienced in coding I wouldn't know what to do with the code and what any of it even mean't. So I decided to pursue an education in Comp Sci to later become a software engineer, After some studying I realized that programming and coding had many applications besides mods for games, Some people code hardware to do specific things like monitor heartbeats or to trigger something when a sensor senses something. I thought it was really cool to learn about all these different applications of coding so I decided to stick to it as my current Major.</p>

    <h2 align=center>What is a Software Engineer?</h2>
    <p>Software engineering is a fast-growing occupation with a high salary potential. From computer operating systems to video games, many of the products we rely upon today are supported by software. Software engineers specialize in either computer software applications or computer software systems. They analyze usersâ€™ needs and then design, test, and develop software by applying the theories and principles of computer science and mathematical analysis. Computers and information technology play a prominent role in our daily lives and in the business world, so there is a constant need to develop new software.<a href="http://www.collegequest.com/how-to-become-a-software-engineer.aspx">(1)</a>
