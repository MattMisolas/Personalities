    <h2>
        What is League of Legends?
    </h2>
    <p>League of Legends is a fast-paced, competitive online game that blends the speed and intensity of an RTS with RPG elements. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a unique design and playstyle, battle head-to-head across multiple battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of champions, frequent updates and a thriving tournament scene, League of Legends offers endless replayability for players of every skill level.<a href="http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/what-is-lol/">(1)</a>
    </p>

    <p>League of Legends is one of my favorite games alongside games like Minecraft or DOTA 2 It's a great alternative to DOTA 2 and is geared more towards casual players but it also shines in the competitive eSports scene. I've been playing League of Legends ever since their first beta and have been playing ever since.</p>
